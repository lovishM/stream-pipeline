# Stream Pipeline 
> Conceptualized from JAVA's stream api, and concept of a flowchart / decision tree.

## Objective of this project
- Create a pipeline with the ability to split it at any point and continue with different pipeline
- Convert the pipeline, or transform it to create an API of decision tree.
- Ability to merge 2 or more decision trees to create a complex decision graph.

## What's done so far
- Simple Pipeline (works on a Single Type from _Creation_ to _Consumption_)
- Complex Pipeline (allows _Transformation_ of types, just like a JAVA stream, though currently nowhere near as powerful)
